 # End-to-End Generative AI Search Engine

This project is an **End-to-End Generative AI Search Engine** that uses LangChain, Streamlit, and an open-source LLM to answer user queries. The system integrates tools like Arxiv, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo search to provide contextual, real-time information, all wrapped in an interactive web app.

## Project Structure

1. **toolagent.ipynb**  
   Contains the configuration for LangChain tools and custom retrievers. This file handles the initialization of the tools and LLM used for building the agent.

2. **app.py**  
   A Streamlit-based web application that interacts with the agent, processes user queries, and displays results interactively. The app uses LangChain's `StreamlitCallbackHandler` to show real-time interactions.

3. **requirements.txt**  
   A file containing all the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Features

- **Wikipedia Search:**  
   Fetches short, concise summaries from Wikipedia.
  
- **Arxiv Search:**  
   Retrieves research paper summaries using Arxiv APIs.
  
- **DuckDuckGo Search:**  
   Provides real-time web search capabilities.
  
- **Interactive Chat Interface:**  
   Powered by Streamlit, allowing easy and intuitive interaction with the system.
  
- **Open Source LLM Integration:**  
   Uses a Groq-based LLM (Llama3) for natural language processing and reasoning.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Anaconda or Miniconda Installed:**
   Install Miniconda or Anaconda if you donâ€™t already have it. You can download it from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_folder>

2. **Create a Conda Environment:**

   ```bash
   conda create -n gen-ai-search python=3.8 -y

3. **Activate the Environment:**

   ```bash
   conda activate gen-ai-search

4. **Install Dependencies: Install the required libraries using requirements.txt:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Set Up Environment Variables:
  **Create a .env file in the project root with the following content:**

  ```bash
  GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key


How to Run
1. Set Up the Tools (Optional):
Open toolagent.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook and run all cells to ensure the tools and agents are set up correctly.

2. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   Start the app by executing:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py

3. **Interact with the App:**

Enter your Groq API Key in the sidebar.
Type your query in the chat input (e.g., "What is machine learning?").
View responses generated in real time.
